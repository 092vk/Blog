Sailing on the same wave; I cleared my Second Evaluations for Google Summer of Code!

The work done in this phase was a little spreaded over all domains. I started off with finalising the User Interface, completed the Pop-up system for Login as well (yet to be implemented on updated master).
Then, along with my mentors get down with merging those PRs. And it was a complete nightmare! With having 10+ files having merge conflicts with each PR getting merged; it took up a huge chunk of time with those tos and fros and the PRs merged.

It's still under process, but I moved on to complete the rest of items off the checklist to avoid lagging behind.

I wrote down the Design Guide for CircuitVerse platform. It was a completely different experience as I had never put down all the thought process behind designing the User Interface formally on a sheet of paper for future contributors to understand and follow.

Further, I dived into the backend too in this phase implementing the much requested functionality for having multiple mentors in a group. Got the backend done for it with frontend pending to be completed on the updated master.
Finally, I moved to work on revamping the Mailer to follow the design language from the platform and be consistent across all mails.

The Final phase is gonna be a lot more packed with a tons of cleanup to be done. And the GDPR features to be incorporated.
Looking forward to finish up this journey with all my Proposal features down to in-production ready to be used by professors and students all over the world.
