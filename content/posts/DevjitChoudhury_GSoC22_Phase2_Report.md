This is the final blog post is to summarize the work done for **VueJS CircuitVerse Simulator project** during **Google Summer of Code @ 2022**.

### [Work Repository ðŸ–¥](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/cv-frontend-vue)
> **[_New FrontEnd Framework for Simulator -_](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/myprojects/details/1IZGKjn2)  
> My project aims to decouple the CircuitVerse Simulator from the backend, remove the use of jQueryUI, and replace DOM mutations using strings and its Internationalization.**

### Project Goals -
---
1. Decoupling Simulator from Backend
2. Internationalization
3. Panels: Elements Panel & Properties Panel Component
4. Navbar and Tabsbar Component
5. DialogBoxes Component
6. Canvas - Pinia Store


### Dialog Boxes Component
---
The dialog boxes were initially coded using JqueryUI and hence converted to Vuetify Dialog components.

#### I. Combinational Analysis
Combinational Analysis had 3 parts -
- Inputs for combinational Analysis
- Displaying the Logic table using the inputs
- Generate a circuit or Print the table from the Logic Table

#### II. Hex-Bin-Dec Converter Dialog
To convert between different numerical forms.

#### III. Save Image Dialog
Provides various image options for the user to export the circuit.

#### IV. Theme Dialog
Dynamic change of theme on selection and also providing options to apply custom themes.

#### V. Custom Shortcut Dialog
For better productivity, set up your favorite shortcuts for different options.

#### VI. Insert Sub-circuit Dialog
Insert one circuit into another as a subcircuit.

#### VII. Export Verilog Code Dialog
Create Verilog code for the circuit drawn and save it.

#### VIII. Save/Open Project Dialog
Save the project offline and open it anytime later to continue working. It has some small bug with the tabs bar not able to render the new circuit list.

### Canvas - Pinia Store
Canvases in CircuitVerse Simulator -
1. BackgroundArea Canvas - base canvas on which the grids are made
2. SimulationArea Canvas - canvas on which the circuit elements are drawn
3. MinimapArea Canvas - canvas showing the minimap of the entire area

Initially, the canvas in the simulator is represented as an object.

First, I had to figure out a way to implement the refactoring without breaking down the simulator since there are a lot of places where canvas objects are used.

Since most of the usage of the canvases is outside the Vue components, I learned [#using a store outside of a component](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/outside-component-usage.html).

> **[_GSoC22 Simulator UI Project_](https://github.com/orgs/CircuitVerse/projects/12)
> With this I have completed all the proposed task for VueJS Simulator Project. Some essential tasks that were added during the coding period will be done next.**

### Future Works -
---
This project provides a base for the VueJS Simulator. 
Though I checked for bugs and solved them while working on the project but still there might be many that I might have missed.
- The most important task now is to integrate this Vue Project into the Main Repository and have an option to switch between the Simulators.
- After the integration - check if the saving online and loading from the server is working.
- Embed Feature - Planning a way to integrate the embed feature into the Vue Simulator.
- Progressive work on Internationalization of Simulator and Refactoring of Styles.
- Few components - Verilog Module, Timing-Diagram, Quick-Button panel, and Testbench are yet to be converted to Vue.

### Experience -
---
The last 12 to 14 weeks were the most amazing in my Coding Journey till now.
I learned so many new things from my mentors and online whenever I was stuck. Overcoming the roadblocks filled me with so much confidence. 

Every week was a journey on its own, some were hectic because of my other involvements and tests and some were relaxing and fun, but that's what I loved about this program, the freedom to come up with my ideas in the proposal, planning its action and then implementing it.

I would like to specially thank [Aboobacker MK](https://github.com/tachyons), [Samiran Konwar](https://github.com/abstrekt), [Ayan Biswas](https://github.com/ayan-biswas0412) and [Ruturaj Mohite](https://github.com/gr455) for conducting weekly meets and all my fellow mentees for always being available to help me whenever I got stuck.
